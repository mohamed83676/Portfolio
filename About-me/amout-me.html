        <p>My name is Mohamed Ahmed and I am 21 year old student at Douglas College. I am farley new to the world of web development so I don't much experience in this department. On the links you will find attached my first 3 labs,they are about all experience I have right now in terms of real projects I've worked but hopefully with enough time and experience I can continue to update this page with more impressive projects.  </p>
